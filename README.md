## Introduction
Unmanaged.Net allows you to efficiently convert a DLL (.Net) so it can be easily injected into a process, as you would with a native DLL.

In my head the idea of injecting a DLL made in .NET (C# / VB) into a process as you would do with a Native DLL (C++) has always been around.
In fact, I made a universal loader [UdrakoLoader](https://github.com/DestroyerDarkNess/Udrakoloader), But I was not completely satisfied and that's why I created this tool.

## What is Unmanaged.NET?

This tool is the final result of my research. Basically, I took a DLL made in .NET, exported a specific function (Equivalent to C++'s DLLMain() / entrypoint) and then I packed it with a stub made in C, finally I compiled the stub generating the new DLL that was already exported.

After these Steps, You can Inject your DLL with any Injector. ðŸ˜Ž

## How to use ?

First we need our DLL made in .NET, then I will put the code of the DLL that we will use:

```c#
using System;
using System.Windows.Forms;

namespace TestLibrary
{
    public class Test
    {
        public static void DllMain()
        {

            MessageBox.Show("Hello World!");

        }

    }
}
```
```VB
Imports System
Imports System.Windows.Forms

Namespace TestLibrary

    Public Class Test

        Public Shared Sub DllMain()

            MessageBox.Show("Hello World!")

        End Sub

    End Class

End Namespace
```

### We already have our DLL, now we will follow these steps:â€‹

- We will open the Tool and Select the DLL (The Methods will be Automatically Loaded)
- We select the Method that will work as the EntryPoint of our DLL.
- We select the Target Architecture to compile for. Usually it is I386
- Press the "Convet To Unmanaged" Button.
- If everything finished Correctly, in the same path of your DLL, there will be another DLL that will have the name of "xxxExported.dll"
- That is your Final DLL, Inject it in any Process!

### Notes

- Your EntryPoint Method of your .NET DLL must be Public and Accessible to everyone.

- The Tool is in its first stable version, there may be errors.
